                    <h2>University Background</h2>
                    <p>My academic journey began at Trinity College Dublin, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and French. 
                      Following this, I pursued graduate studies at the University of Lille, completing a Master's in Foreign Language Learning and Teaching, which led to my doctoral work.</p>
                    <p>I was awarded a PhD in Language Sciences from the University of Lille, focusing on linguistics and language acquisition. This rigorous research experience honed my abilities in data analysis, methodical investigation, and complex problem-solving
                       – skills that prove remarkably transferable to computing and data science.</p>
                    <p>After my doctorate, I spent ten years as a Senior Lecturer at the University of Lille, where I balanced teaching, administrative leadership, and research responsibilities. 
                      This multifaceted role developed my project management capabilities and collaborative working style, which complement technical team environments perfectly.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I'm expanding my technical foundations via TU Dublin's Computing Masters Qualifier, studying database design, systems analysis, computer architecture, and programming. 
                      This formal education builds upon my earlier self-directed exploration of low/no-code tools during my time as a language consultant in Brussels, where I created online learning modules and websites.</p>
                    <p>My next educational milestone will be starting an MSc in Data Science in September 2025, formally bridging my analytical research background with emerging technical skills in a field where 
                      language, mathematics, and computing intersect in fascinating ways.</p>

                    <h2>Freelance Work</h2>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I've maintained a parallel path as a freelance language consultant, providing specialized services that complement my academic work. Beginning in Lille, 
                      I developed a dual professional identity by working with both corporate clients and university researchers.</p>
                    <p>From 2006 to 2009, I delivered customized language training programs for businesses while also proofreading academic publications. 
                      This work involved assessing organizational needs, designing tailored materials, and managing complete project cycles from initial consultation to final implementation and feedback</p>
                    <p>Even after becoming a Senior Lecturer, I continued these freelance activities, helping scholars refine their manuscripts for international journals while delivering specialized language instruction. 
                      This ongoing practice maintained my connections with both corporate environments and the broader research community.</p>
                    <p>In Brussels during 2024, I expanded my service offerings to include public speaking training alongside professional language courses in French and English. 
                      This period marked an important evolution as I began exploring digital solutions for language learning, creating online modules and websites using Low/No Code tools—
                      an experience that directly informed my current transition to computing.</p>
                    <p>This consistent thread of freelance work has honed my abilities to communicate complex ideas clearly, adapt to diverse client needs, and manage projects—skills that transfer naturally 
                      to technical environments where clear documentation and user-focused design are essential.</p>
