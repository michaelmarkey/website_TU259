                    <h2>University Background</h2>
                    <p>I began my academic path at Trinity College Dublin, earning a degree in Mathematics and French. This blend of disciplines laid the foundation for graduate 
                      studies at the University of Lille, where I completed a Master’s in Foreign Language Learning and Teaching and later pursued a PhD in Language Sciences.</p>
                    <br><p>My doctoral research focused on linguistics and language acquisition, sharpening my skills in data analysis, structured investigation, and complex problem-solving. 
                      These capabilities now support my transition into computing and data science, where similar analytical thinking is essential.</p>
                    <br><p>I went on to spend a decade as a Senior Lecturer at the University of Lille, leading programs, managing teams, and contributing to academic research. This role 
                      deepened my experience with project coordination and collaboration—skills that translate well to technical and team-based environments.</p>
                    <br><p>In recent years, I’ve expanded my technical skill set through TU Dublin’s Computing Masters Qualifier, studying systems analysis, database design, computer architecture, and programming. 
                      This formal training builds on earlier hands-on work with low-code tools and online course development during my time as a language consultant in Brussels.</p>
                    <br><p>Looking ahead, I’ll begin an MSc in Data Science in September 2025. This next step brings together my background in language and mathematics with new technical 
                      expertise—an intersection where my skills align naturally with the demands of data-driven work.</p>

                    <h2>Freelance Work</h2>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I've maintained a parallel path as a freelance language consultant, providing specialized services that complement my academic work. Beginning in Lille, 
                      I developed a dual professional identity by working with both corporate clients and university researchers.</p>
                    <br><p>From 2006 to 2009, I delivered customized language training programs for businesses while also proofreading academic publications. 
                      This work involved assessing organizational needs, designing tailored materials, and managing complete project cycles from initial consultation to final implementation and feedback</p>
                    <br><p>Even after becoming a Senior Lecturer, I continued these freelance activities, helping scholars refine their manuscripts for international journals while delivering specialized language instruction. 
                      This ongoing practice maintained my connections with both corporate environments and the broader research community.</p>
                    <br><p>In Brussels during 2024, I expanded my service offerings to include public speaking training alongside professional language courses in French and English. 
                      I also began exploring digital solutions for language learning, creating online modules and websites using Low/No Code tools—
                      an experience that directly informed my current transition to computing.</p>
                    <br><p>This consistent thread of freelance work has honed my abilities to communicate complex ideas clearly, adapt to diverse client needs, and manage projects—skills that transfer naturally 
                      to technical environments where clear documentation and user-focused design are essential.</p>
