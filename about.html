                  <h2>Life on the Continent</h2>
                  <p>My life in Lille began as a bit of an adventure after finishing my degree at Trinity. 
                    I initially planned to spend just a year or two as an English teaching assistant at Lille's Science and Technology campus, but something about the city and its rhythm captivated me.</p>
                  <br><p>The city itself was a wonderful contrast – historic architecture in the old town with its characteristic red brick buildings and cobblestone streets, 
                    yet modern and vibrant with its large student population.</p>
                  <br><p>As my time at Lille University extended from my Master's into my doctoral studies, I built a rich social circle that blended French colleagues, international researchers, and expatriates. 
                    Weekends often involved cycling through the flat countryside that surrounds Lille, or taking quick train trips to nearby Belgium for a change of scenery.</p>
                  <br><p>My move to Brussels came later, after I had established myself professionally. The city offered a different energy – more international, multilingual, and politically charged due to the EU 
                    institutions. </p>
                  <br><p>Brussels provided a fascinating mix of French and Flemish influences, creating a unique cultural identity. I enjoyed exploring the city's distinct neighborhoods – from the grand 
                    architecture around the Royal Palace to the quirky charm of Saint-Gilles. </p>
                  <br><p>Throughout my time in both cities, I maintained connections to Ireland through regular visits home, but France and Belgium truly became my second homes. 
                    Those twenty years shaped not just my career but my worldview, my taste in food and wine, and even my sense of humor. </p>
                  <br><p>Looking back, what was meant to be a brief post-college experience evolved into the most formative chapter of my life. I've been lucky enough to live half my life in Ireland and half on the contient.
                    Here's to what the next chapter brings...</p>

                  <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
                  <p>I grew up in Dublin in the ’80s and ’90s playing Gaelic football and hurling with <a href="https://ballinteerstjohnsgaa.com/" target="_blank">Ballinteer St John’s</a>. 
                  My father, a founding member of <a href="https://www.stackstowngolfclub.ie/" target="_blank">Stackstown Golf Club</a>, taught me to play golf, and I spent many mornings on the fairway working on my drives.</p>
                  <br><p>I started learning Irish at four, studied both French and German and spent summers in the Gaeltacht improving my Irish. 
                  More recently I started learning Spanish and, while living in Brussels, I took Dutch classes.</p>
                  <br><p>After college I moved to <a href="https://en.lilletourism.com/" target="_blank">Lille</a> in France. Not many people in Ireland know about it but it’s the biggest French city north of Paris. 
                  It’s also the most Flemish, with a wonderful mix of Belgian and local traditions and architecture. 
                  When I lived there, I used to cycle from Lille to <a href="https://www.visitflanders.com/en/flemish-destinations/kortrijk" target="_blank">Kortrijk</a> along the Flemish country roads.</p> 
                  <br><p>One of the most interesting aspects of the culture there is the carnivals, like <a href="https://www.dunkirk-tourism.com/things-to-do/go-local/major-events/" target="_blank">Dunkirk Carnival</a> 
                  and the <a href="https://www.binche.be/en/things-to-do/carnivals/carnival-of-binche" target="_blank">Carnival of Binche</a>. Also, if you ever get the chance, go to the <a href="https://visit.gent.be/en/festivals-feasts" target="_blank">Gentse Feesten</a>…</p>
                  <br><p>Beyond travel and sport, I’ve always been drawn to nightlife. I recently joined the <a href="https://www.tudublin.ie/student-life/activities/societies/dublin-institute-of-technology-dublin-city-university-societies-committee/dj-society/" target="_blank">TU Dublin DJ society</a> 
                  out of pure curiosity and am getting back into club culture in Dublin. I’m still learning beat-matching but hopefully some day you’ll come across one of my mixes.</p>
                  <br><p>My favourite pastime is to explore on foot. In Dublin, it’s up and down the <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/guides/dublin-coastal-trail" target="_blank">coast</a>. In Lille, it’s around the <a href="https://parcdelacitadelle.lille.fr/en" target="_blank">Citadelle of Lille</a>. 
                  In Brussels, it’s the <a href="https://www.visit.brussels/en/visitors/venue-details.The-Promenade-Verte.266020" target="_blank">Coulée Verte</a>, a huge loop around the region that takes you through the industrial past right up to the modern metropolis.</p>
                  <br><p>After Dublin, <a href="https://www.visit.brussels/en/visitors" target="_blank">Brussels</a> is my favourite city. It gets labelled as a bureaucratic bore, but you’d be hard pushed to find a more interesting and varied place. 
                  You can find every nationality under the sun, a mix of everything from the garish to the refined, and a joyous cacophony of languages to boot!</p>
