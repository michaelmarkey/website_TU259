                  <h2>Life on the Continent</h2>
                  <p>After finishing my degree at Trinity College Dublin, I moved to Lille with the idea of spending just a year or two as an English teaching assistant. 
                    What began as a short-term plan quickly turned into something more permanent, as I found myself drawn to the city’s pace, atmosphere, and charm.</p>
                  <br><p>Lille offered a striking blend of old and new—its red brick architecture and cobbled streets giving way to lively squares and a thriving student scene. 
                    The city felt both historic and forward-looking, and that balance suited me well as I transitioned into graduate studies and then doctoral research at the university.</p>
                  <br><p>Over time, I built a strong social network made up of French colleagues, international researchers, and fellow expatriates. My weekends were often spent cycling 
                    through the northern countryside or hopping on a train to nearby Belgium, making the most of Lille’s location at the heart of Europe.</p>

                    <br><p>Years later, I relocated to Brussels to take on freelance work in language consulting. The shift brought a new rhythm—faster-paced and more international, with the 
                    influence of the EU institutions shaping the city’s energy. Brussels offered new cultural layers, from the bilingual street signs to its famously eclectic neighborhoods. </p>
                  <br><p>Throughout my two decades abroad, I stayed closely connected to Ireland through regular visits home. But France and Belgium became more than places I lived—they 
                    shaped how I think, work, and experience the world. What started as a post-college adventure became the most formative chapter of my life.</p>

                  <p>I grew up in Dublin in the ’80s and ’90s playing Gaelic football and hurling with <a href="https://ballinteerstjohnsgaa.com/" target="_blank">Ballinteer St John’s</a>. 
                  My father, a founding member of <a href="https://www.stackstowngolfclub.ie/" target="_blank">Stackstown Golf Club</a>, taught me to play golf, and I spent many mornings on the fairway working on my drives.</p>

                  <br><p>I started learning Irish at four, studied both French and German and spent summers in the Gaeltacht improving my Irish. 
                  More recently I started learning Spanish and, while living in Brussels, I took Dutch classes.</p>
                  <br><p>After college I moved to <a href="https://en.lilletourism.com/" target="_blank">Lille</a> in France. Not many people in Ireland know about it but it’s the biggest French city north of Paris. 
                  It’s also the most Flemish, with a wonderful mix of Belgian and local traditions and architecture. 
                  When I lived there, I used to cycle from Lille to <a href="https://www.visitflanders.com/en/flemish-destinations/kortrijk" target="_blank">Kortrijk</a> along the Flemish country roads.</p> 
                  <br><p>One of the most interesting aspects of the culture there is the carnivals, like <a href="https://www.dunkirk-tourism.com/things-to-do/go-local/major-events/" target="_blank">Dunkirk Carnival</a> 
                  and the <a href="https://www.binche.be/en/things-to-do/carnivals/carnival-of-binche" target="_blank">Carnival of Binche</a>. Also, if you ever get the chance, go to the <a href="https://visit.gent.be/en/festivals-feasts" target="_blank">Gentse Feesten</a>…</p>
                  <br><p>Beyond travel and sport, I’ve always been drawn to nightlife. I recently joined the <a href="https://www.tudublin.ie/student-life/activities/societies/dublin-institute-of-technology-dublin-city-university-societies-committee/dj-society/" target="_blank">TU Dublin DJ society</a> 
                  out of pure curiosity and am getting back into club culture in Dublin. I’m still learning beat-matching but hopefully some day you’ll come across one of my mixes.</p>
                  <br><p>My favourite pastime is to explore on foot. In Dublin, it’s up and down the <a href="https://www.visitdublin.com/guides/dublin-coastal-trail" target="_blank">coast</a>. In Lille, it’s around the <a href="https://parcdelacitadelle.lille.fr/en" target="_blank">Citadelle of Lille</a>. 
                  In Brussels, it’s the <a href="https://www.visit.brussels/en/visitors/venue-details.The-Promenade-Verte.266020" target="_blank">Coulée Verte</a>, a huge loop around the region that takes you through the industrial past right up to the modern metropolis.</p>
